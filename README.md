webgo
=====

Web based version of the board game Go, with a simple AI service.

Game and interface written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, with AI in Java.

AI suggests moves for whoever's turn it currently is, marking the
suggested location with a black or white circle outline. For AI to
function, GoAI.java and the files it depends on must be compiled and
run locally so that the page can access it at 127.0.0.1:8080.
